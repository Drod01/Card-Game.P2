# Card Clash

This is a simple card game implementation in C. The code consists of two files: `cards.h` and `cards.c`.

## Description

The card game involves creating a deck of cards with different types (ATTACK, DEFEND, RUN) and values. Players can perform various actions based on the type of the card drawn. The game logic and card management are handled by the functions defined in `cards.c`.

## Getting Started

To get started with the card game implementation, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the code repository to your local machine.
3. Open the project in your preferred C development environment.

### Usage

1. Include the `cards.h` header in your C program.
2. Implement the game logic using the provided functions to manage the cards.
3. Compile and run your program.

Make sure to link the `cards.c` file during the compilation process.

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the card game implementation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "cards.h"

int main() {
    // Build a deck of 10 cards
    Card* deck = buildCards(10);

    // Print the initial deck
    printf("Initial Deck: ");
    printCards(deck);

    // Remove the first card from the deck
    deck = removeCard(deck);

    // Add a new card to the deck
    Card* newCard = createCard();
    deck = addCard(deck, newCard);

    // Print the updated deck
    printf("Updated Deck: ");
    printCards(deck);

    // Destroy the deck and free the memory
    deck = destroyCards(deck);

    return 0;
}
```
